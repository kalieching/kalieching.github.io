            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Hi everyone! My name is Kalie Ching (she/her/hers), and I am a senior at
              UC Berkeley majoring in computer science and minoring in data science.
              I am an undergraduate researcher at the Mechanical Systems Control
              Laboratory and an intern with the Boston Dynamics AI Institute for the
              fall of 2023. I have also been an <a id="link" href="https://eecs16b.org/" target="_blank">
              EECS 16B</a> Lab TA for the past three semesters. In the past, I interned
              at Cruise as an Autonomy Systems Engineer Intern, Microsoft as a Software
              Engineer Intern on the Azure Data team, and NASA as part of the
              <a id="link" href="https://www.nasa.gov/astrobee" target="_blank"> Astrobee Facility
              Project</a> at the Ames Research Center!</p>

            <p>My current research focuses on 3D vision and NLP, and my interests lie in
              robotics and autonomous intelligent systems. Iâ€™m very curious about perception,
              human computer interaction, and machine intelligence from a cognitive
              science lens.</p>

            <p>When I'm not working, I love spending time with family and friends, exploring
              new mediums and techniques of art, playing with my dog Rico, teaching,
              hanging out with friends, sounding out songs on the piano/guitar, or going
              on spontaneous outdoor adventures!</p>
