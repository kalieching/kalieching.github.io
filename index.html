                  <p>Hi everyone! My name is Kalie Ching (she/her/hers), and I am a research engineer at 
                    <a id="link" href="https://rai-inst.com/">The Robotics and AI Institute (RAI)</a> working 
                    on reinforcement learning and conditioning for robot policy learning. I previously built
                     3D perception systems for robots that learn skills from human videos.</p>
                  <p>Prior to this role, I graduated from UC Berkeley with a major in computer science and a minor in 
                    data science. I am independently wrapping up research tasks originating from an undergraduate 
                    research position at the <a id="link" href="https://msc.berkeley.edu/">
                    Mechanical Systems Control Laboratory</a> and previously interned at RAI 
                    during the fall of 2023. During my time at Berkeley, I taught <a id="link" href="https://eecs16b.org/">
                    EECS 16B</a> as a Lab TA/tutor for four semesters. In the past, I interned at 
                    <a id="link" href="https://www.gm.com/innovation/autonomous-driving/">Cruise (now GM)</a> as an Autonomy Systems Engineer 
                    Intern, Microsoft as a Software Engineer Intern on the

                    Astrobee Facility Project</a> at the Ames Research Center!</p>

                  <p>I studied fine arts for 13+ years at a local <a id="link" href="https://www.sjaart.com/">art studio</a>. 
                    When I'm not working, I love staying active (tennis, winter sports, gymming) and exploring 
                    character and fashion design.</p>

                    <p>
                      Today, I built my own DIY LLM (without the help of LLMs). I followed "Let's build GPT" from Andrej Karpathy.

                    <h3>1/19/2026 ⋆ create more than i consume</h3>
                    <p>
                      This year, my goal is to create more than I consume.
                      <br><br>
                      Towards the end of 2025, I felt like I filled every nook and cranny of my day with 
                      consumption. I would read books at the gym, scroll financial subreddits on the train, 
                      watch gaming videos while eating meals, and lay in bed viewing reels at night before sleeping. 
                      These all seem pretty typical, but then it became worse. I would be motivated by self-help 
                      podcasts or these reels to work on personal projects, start a startup, make a product, etc. 
                      but all I would do is save the respective reels to folders on Instagram. Or I’d write 
                      ideas down on Notion. Because I did something, and not nothing, these simple, yet 
                      unproductive acts tickled a part of my brain and tricked it into feeling like 
                      something had been accomplished. In reality, all I was doing was piling more and 
                      more information onto an already large pile of content. How many of those reels did 
                      I really look back at? How many of those checklist items did I actually check off on 
                      my high-level todo list? I struggled, and still struggle to follow through. My intention 
                      for this year is to not let those resources gather dust on my virtual shelves, and set my 
                      focus on completing projects, even if they’re imperfect. My focus areas for tangible 
                      artifacts are robotics/ML research, writing, music, and health.
                      <br><br>
                      Sometimes, though, Doing Something does not always feel like anything is being done. This is 
                      the Invisible Reward. I work out or do some sort of sport 4-5 times a week, leaving me objectively 
                      somewhat fit. I meal prep 1-2 times a week using authentic Chinese recipes, while paying close 
                      attention to using low-fat, high-nutrient wholesome ingredients. The part I struggle with, 
                      however, is that while these habits are good, their outcomes largely fall under the category 
                      of maintenance rather than improvement. That doesn’t mean I shouldn’t do them, and frankly, 
                      my life would become significantly worse if I didn’t. I must learn to be satisfied by my healthy 
                      body being the artifact. 
                      <br><br>
                      Even though maintenance demands a portion of my time, I’ve found that I’m the least happy when 
                      my life is only work (robotics/ML pillar), maintenance (despite contributing to my health pillar), 
                      and social. For better or worse, I’ve taken back my time significantly by reducing social. I don’t 
                      attend hangouts on the weekdays other than puzzling events and hard-to-get restaurant reservations. 
                      Instead, I stack exercise and social and keep my Fridays and Saturdays only for social. This leaves 
                      room for what truly fulfills me and brings me joy: creating my ideas. Robotics and ML side projects. 
                      Apps and web extensions that are precisely the kinds of software I want in my life specifically. 
                      Drawing, animating, and even playing music. It makes me feel explosive, bursting with ideas and the 
                      momentum of learning new skills or using existing skills in new ways.
                      <br><br>
                      To keep my sanity, I think it’s important to have a balance of maintenance and creative bursts. 
                      The true culprit is perfectionism and fear of judgement flooding in to prevent creatons 
                      from making it to the landing page. I just need to Do Things, Publish Things, and hit Send 
                      when I don’t feel ready. Even by writing this I am taking one step closer to my goal. That 
                      truly makes me happy. I hope that by the end of this year, I have a page full of my creations - 
                      tangible, real artifacts, not just imaginations in my head.</p>
